/**
 * In this package and its sub-packages is a collection of premade {@code Matcher}s
 * that work with a lot of common types, such as collections.
 * <p>
 * When using the matchers, it is recommended to use a static import of the class
 * called {@code ___Matchers} in the package instead of one of the actual 
 * {@code Matcher} classes. This provides access to <i>all</i> of the matchers
 * in the package, including the inverted versions.</p>
 * <p>
 * For example, in this package, there is the {@code BasicMatchers} class which
 * contains static methods for all of the {@code Matcher}s in this package, such
 * as {@code isNull()}. The {@code Matcher}s in this package are ones that work
 * with all objects.</p>
